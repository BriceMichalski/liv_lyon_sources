What's Liv'Lyon?
--------------

Liv Lyon is a student association whose goal is to refer to atypical places and entertaining events. 
The places we visit are caf√©s, bars, museums or any other tourist, cultural or festive places. 
The events covered can also range from a game of your favourite sport, to a Sunday morning yoga gathering. 
The purpose of this association, beyond entertaining and informing its public, is to encourage people 
to leave their homes to discover the city around them.
